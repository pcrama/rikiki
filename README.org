#+TITLE: Rikiki Card Game Web Application
#+AUTHOR: Philippe Crama

* Introduction
Rikiki is a card game I played as a child.  This web application must allow to
play together over the internet.

* Stories
** User types
There is one organizer: he sends out an invitation to the players (the
organizer may be a player, too).  Once all players have accepted the
invitation by clicking the link, the organizer starts the game.  The cards are
dealt and the game proceeds.

** As the organizer, I want to generate a different invitation link for each player
- The organizer provides a list of names.
- The invitations are shared over a different channel (outside the
  scope of this application).
- The invitations must be difficult to guess.
- The organizer may be a player, but the player and organizer pages are
  separate.

** As a player, I want to accept an invitation link to register in the game
- Clicking an invitation link, the player sees his name prefilled but
  may edit it before confirming/joining.
- Once joined, the player can observe the other players joining the
  game.  The player has no cards yet.

** As the organizer, I want to start the game/next round
- The organizer
  1. Selects how many cards to deal (prefilled with max amount of
     cards available per player, then decreasing by 1 after each
     round),
  2. clicks a button to start the game once all players are
     connected.
- Once the game is started, no more players can connect to the game.
- A player leaving the game is outside the scope of this application.
- The cards are dealt to all players according to the rules of the
  game.  If not all cards can be dealt, the top card is turned: its
  colour sets the trump's colour.
- All players can see only their cards and the trump colour.

** As a player, I want to bid when it's my turn
- Each player sees the previous player's bids when they are confirmed.
- Each player can confirm his bid only when the previous players have
  confirmed.

** As a player, I want to play a card
- All players must confirm their bid before the first card is played.
- A player may only play a card when it is his turn.
- It is not possible to take back a card.
- Once every player has put down one card, the winner gets the trick.
- The round ends when all cards have been played.
- Scoring is outside the scope of this application.

* Implementation
** Hosting
- Probably on repl.it, with settings similar to these and a link to
  https://repl.it/github/pcrama/rikiki for a repl.it badge.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    language = "python3"
    run = "FLASK_APP=flaskr FLASK_ENV=production python3 -m flask run --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0"
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- No database, all data is in memory.

** Security
- No logins, the security is based on hard to guess links to set a
  session cookie.
- There is 1! organizer and 1! game.
