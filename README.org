#+TITLE: Rikiki Card Game Web Application
#+AUTHOR: Philippe Crama

* Introduction
Rikiki is a card game I played as a child.  This web application must allow to
play together over the internet.

* Stories
** User types
There is one organizer: he sends out an invitation to the players (the
organizer may be a player, too).  Once all players have accepted the
invitation by clicking the link, the organizer starts the game.  The cards are
dealt and the game proceeds.

** As the organizer, I want to generate a different invitation link for each player
- The organizer provides a list of names.
- The invitations are shared over a different channel (outside the
  scope of this application).
- The invitations must be difficult to guess.
- The organizer may be a player, but the player and organizer pages are
  separate.

** As a player, I want to accept an invitation link to register in the game
- Clicking an invitation link, the player sees his name prefilled but
  may edit it before confirming/joining.
- Once joined, the player can observe the other players joining the
  game.  The player has no cards yet.

** As the organizer, I want to start the game/next round
- The organizer
  1. Selects how many cards to deal (prefilled with max amount of
     cards available per player, then decreasing by 1 after each
     round),
  2. clicks a button to start the game once all players are
     connected.
- Once the game is started, no more players can connect to the game.
- A player leaving the game is outside the scope of this application.
- The cards are dealt to all players according to the rules of the
  game.  If not all cards can be dealt, the top card is turned: its
  colour sets the trump's colour.
- All players can see only their cards and the trump colour.

** As a player, I want to bid when it's my turn
- Each player sees the previous player's bids when they are confirmed.
- Each player can confirm his bid only when the previous players have
  confirmed.

** As a player, I want to play a card
- All players must confirm their bid before the first card is played.
- A player may only play a card when it is his turn.
- It is not possible to take back a card.
- Once every player has put down one card, the winner gets the trick.
- The round ends when all cards have been played.
- Scoring is outside the scope of this application.

** As an organizer, I want to start a new gama
- This 'kills' the previously running game.
- It is OK for the organizer to enter the player names again.

* Implementation
** Hosting
- Probably on repl.it, with settings similar to these and a link to
  https://repl.it/github/pcrama/rikiki for a repl.it badge.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    language = "python3"
    run = "FLASK_APP=flaskr FLASK_ENV=production python3 -m flask run --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0"
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- No database, all data is in memory.
- Running locally for testing: ~python -m flask run --port 8080~.

** i18n
Following the information [[https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xiii-i18n-and-l10n][here]].
*** Extract all texts to translate
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports code
  cd app
  pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k _l -o messages.pot .
#+END_SRC

~messages.pot~ may be ignored in version control.
*** Translating
1. Generate skeleton file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports code
     for lang in fr ; do \
       pybabel $( \
                 if [ -r translations/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po ] ; \
                 then echo update ; \
                 else echo init ; fi) \
               -i messages.pot \
               -d translations \
               -l $lang ; \
     done
   #+END_SRC
2. Translate the strings in
   ~app/translations/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po~.
3. Compile to a more compact/efficient representation:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports code
     pybabel compile -d translations
   #+END_SRC

** Security
- No logins, the security is based on hard to guess links to set a
  session cookie.
- There is 1! organizer and 1! game.
** Classes
*** Models
**** Game
The Game is responsible for
- handling the confirming of the players,
- sequencing the Rounds: in Rikiki, the number of cards
  dealt is reduced by 1 at each step.

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The ~done~ â†’ ~confirming~ transition is a convenience method: it
allows the organizer to restart the game without having to distribute
links to all Players again.  The ~restart_with_same_players~ method
shuffles the players.

**** Round
A round is part of a game: in a round
1. Each player receives their cards,
2. Each player places their bid,
3. The players play their cards when it is their turn until no cards
   are left.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file doc/models_player_round_sequence_diagram.png

  actor "P 1" as A1
  actor "P 2" as A2

  R --> P1 : add_trick
  R --> G : round_finished  
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The ~Round~ only maintains the cards on the table of the current trick.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file doc/models_round_state_diagram.png
  hide empty description

  playing --> between_tricks : play_card\nall players\nhave same\ncard_count//>0//
  between_tricks --> playing : play_card,\nreset\ncurrent_trick
  playing --> done : play_card\nall players\nhave 0\ncards left
  done --> [*]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:doc/models_round_state_diagram.png]]

The ~between_tricks~ state allows Players to see which card the last
Player put on the table when the trick ended.

*** Controllers
